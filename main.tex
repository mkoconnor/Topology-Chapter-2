% Welcome, Math for Math's sake folks!
%
% My idea is to use this file as a way to share solutions, questions, and comments.
%
% Feel free to edit any part of it, and add ``Your name:your comment, question, or solution'' so we know who is asking what.
%
% You don't have to worry too much about making mistakes in LaTeX format: ShareLatex keeps track of the file's history, so it's pretty easy to fix mistakes.  There's help here if you want to learn LaTeX and ShareLatex: https://www.sharelatex.com/learn
%
% If you're a techy person, this is also linked to a github repo here: https://github.com/mkoconnor/Topology-Chapter-2 Feel free to submit a pull request.  If you've never heard of github, just ignore this paragraph.
%
% This is a total experiment, and I'm not sure if will people will like or use it, but let's find out!
